# The-Daily-Compress
An AI driven article writer that writes everyday about a randomly choosen topic and is posted to thedailycompress.com  

[TheDailyCompress.com](https://itzcozi.github.io/The-Daily-Compress/)

## Motivation
I made this website after watching a moist critical video on Chat-GPT writing an article and the result 
was very cool and after a couple of weeks waiting on Chat-GPT to release on openAI API I decided to build the 
writer with GPT-3, after I was happy with the AI/script I thought to make a website to post all of the articles to. 
I dont recommend using any of these articles as trustworthy information and all articles should be fact checked 
before use in any other media.
