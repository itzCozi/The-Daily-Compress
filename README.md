# The-Daily-Compress
An AI driven article writer that writes everyday about a randomly chosen topic and is posted to [thedailycompress.com](https://itzcozi.github.io/The-Daily-Compress/)

![Website article](.github/TDC.Home.Page.jpg "Website article")

## Motivation
I made this website after watching a moist critical video on Chat-GPT writing an article and the result  
was very cool and after a couple of weeks waiting on Chat-GPT to release on openAI API I decided to build the  
writer with GPT-3, after I was happy with the AI/script I thought to make a website to post all of the articles to.  
I dont recommend using any of these articles as trustworthy information and all articles should be fact checked  
before use in any other media.
