The United States education system is in a state of crisis. From pre-kindergarten to college and beyond, our country's schools are failing to provide students with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy. According to a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States ranks 36th out of 65 countries in math and 27th in reading. These international rankings are based on the results of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which tests 15-year-olds in 65 countries on reading, math, and science. The United States has also fallen behind in graduation rates. According to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics, the graduation rate for high school students in the United States is 80%. This means that 1 in 5 students does not graduate from high school. The United States also ranks behind other countries in college graduation rates. According to data from the OECD, the United States ranks 12th out of 36 countries in the proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds with a tertiary education (higher education). There are many reasons for the poor performance of the United States education system. One reason is the high levels of poverty in the United States. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 21.3% of people in the United States live in poverty. This is the highest poverty rate among all developed countries. Poverty has a profound effect on education. Children who grow up in poverty are more likely to attend schools that are underfunded and have less experienced teachers. They are also more likely to drop out of school. Another reason for the poverty crisis.
