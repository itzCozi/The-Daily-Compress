There are many reasons why you should swap to Linux, the most popular open source operating system. Here are just a few: 
It's free - Unlike Windows and macOS, you won't have to pay a penny for Linux. Not only is the operating system free, but many of 
the applications are too. It's more secure - Linux is much less vulnerable to viruses and malware than Windows. This is because there 
are fewer viruses and malware designed for Linux, and because it's easier to secure a Linux system. It's more stable - Linux is designed 
to be stable and to run smoothly, even on older hardware. It's customizable - You can customize Linux to look and feel however you want. 
There are hundreds of different "distributions" (flavors) of Linux, each with its own unique look and feel. It's compatible - Linux is 
compatible with a wide range of hardware, from servers to smartphones. It's easy to use - Linux has come a long way in terms of usability. 
It's now just as easy to use as Windows or macOS. It's green - Linux is a more efficient way to use your computer resources. This means that 
you can run Linux on older hardware, or on a "green" computer that uses less electricity. It's fun - Linux is a great platform for learning 
about computers. And it's also a lot of fun to use.
