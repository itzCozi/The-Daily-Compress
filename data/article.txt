It's been over 20 years since the release of Half-Life, a game that changed the first-person shooter genre forever. In the intervening years, we've seen countless games try to imitate its success, but few have come close to matching its impact. Half-Life's influence can still be felt today in everything from the way we play first-person shooters to the way we think about story in games. Half-Life was released in 1998 by Valve, a then-unknown studio composed of former Microsoft employees. The game put players in the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a scientist who must find his way out of a research facility after a failed experiment unleashes a horde of deadly creatures. What made Half-Life so special was the way it blended action and story. Most first-person shooters at the time were focused on pure gameplay, with little regard for narrative. Half-Life changed that by giving players a reason to care about Gordon and the world he inhabited. The game was also notable for its use of environment storytelling. Rather than relying on exposition-heavy cutscenes, Half-Life conveyed its story through the environment itself. Players could find journals and memos that fleshed out the backstory of the game's world, and the game's levels were designed to give players a sense of the history and culture of the research facility. Half-Life's success ushered in a new era of first-person shooters that placed a greater emphasis on story. Games like Halo and Call of Duty would not exist in the same form without Half-Life's influence. In the years since its release, Half-Life has greatly impacted the gaming industry for the better.
