It's been a tough year for Facebook. The social media giant has been embroiled in a series of scandals, ranging from its mishandling of user data to its failure to prevent the spread of misinformation. And now, it seems, the public is finally turning on Facebook. A new poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal found that 43 percent of Americans say they have a negative view of Facebook, while just 24 percent have a positive view. It's a dramatic reversal from just a few years ago, when Facebook was seen as a revolutionary force for good. So what went wrong? Here are four reasons why Facebook is falling out of favor with the American public. The Cambridge Analytica scandal The Cambridge Analytica scandal was a wake-up call for many Facebook users. The scandal revealed that Facebook had allowed a third-party firm to access the personal data of millions of users without their knowledge or consent. The data was then used to create targeted political ads during the 2016 election. The scandal sparked a major backlash against Facebook, with many users vowing to delete their accounts in protest. The spread of misinformation Facebook has also come under fire for its role in the spread of misinformation. During the 2016 election, fake news stories circulated on the social network, causing some people to question the accuracy of the information they were seeing. Facebook has since taken steps to combat the spread of misinformation, but the damage has been done. The company's handling of user data Facebook has been criticized for its handling of user data ever since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The company has been accused of being too lax with its user data, and of not doing enough to protect users' privacy. Facebook is now facing several lawsuits over its handling of user data, and the issue is them.
